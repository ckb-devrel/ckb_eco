The native token, CKByte, serves three key functions: paying for computation, transaction fees, and state rent. The model includes two issuance mechanisms: Base Issuance, which subsidizes security early on with a predictable halving schedule, and Secondary Issuance, a small, fixed annual inflation incentivizing miners, compensates Nervos DAO participants and supports ongoing development. By holding CKBytes in Nervos DAO, users can offset the inflationary effects of Secondary Issuance and earn interest while contributing to the network's security and stability."
